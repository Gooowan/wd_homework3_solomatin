How to Cook Vareniki

Vareniki are a traditional Eastern European dish, similar to dumplings, often filled with a variety of ingredients such as potatoes, cheese, fruits, or even meat. Here’s a simple guide on how to make potato-filled vareniki.

Ingredients:

2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup water
1 large egg
2 cups mashed potatoes
1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese
Salt and pepper to taste
Butter and onions for serving (optional)
Instructions:

Prepare the Dough:
In a large bowl, combine flour and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Make a well in the center and add the egg and water. Mix to form a soft dough. Knead on a floured surface until smooth, about 5 minutes. Cover with a cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.
Prepare the Filling:
Mix mashed potatoes with cheddar cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Form the Vareniki:
Divide the dough into two parts. Roll out one part on a floured surface until it's about 1/8 inch thick. Using a glass or cookie cutter, cut out circles from the dough.
Place a small spoonful of the potato filling in the center of each circle. Fold the dough over to form a half-moon shape and pinch the edges to seal.
Cook the Vareniki:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Carefully drop the vareniki into the water and cook for 3-5 minutes or until they float to the surface. Remove with a slotted spoon.
Serve:
Serve hot with melted butter, sautéed onions, or sour cream. Enjoy your delicious homemade vareniki!
